#  Login & Register System (Tkinter)

##  Overview
This project is a simple Login and Register desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter.
It demonstrates basic GUI programming, user input validation, and button state management.

This application is ideal for beginners who want to practice building real GUI projects with Python.

##  Features
- Login with username and password
- Register a new user
- Password masking with Show / Hide toggle
- Input validation (no empty fields allowed)
- Register button remains disabled until all fields are filled
- Press Enter key to trigger Login

##  Technologies
- Python 3
- Tkinter
- tkinter.messagebox

##  How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Save the file as `login_system.py`
3. Run the application:
   python login_system.py

##  Project Structure
login_system.py
README.md

##  How It Works
- The user enters a username and password
- The system validates the inputs
- Login checks credentials against predefined data
- Register allows adding a new user (in memory only)
- Password visibility can be toggled using a button

##  Limitations
- User data is not stored permanently
- No database or file storage
- Passwords are not encrypted

##  Future Improvements
- Save users to a file or database
- Encrypt passwords using hashing
- Separate Login and Register windows
- Add password confirmation field
